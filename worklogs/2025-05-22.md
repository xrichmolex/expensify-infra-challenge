## Process

START TIME: 4:14 PM CST

Spent some time trying to figure out what load balancing algorithm to use for this project. Originally I was thinking of
implementing a load based scheduling algorithm with cookies to implement the stickiness that is desired.  However, I
spent some time to review various load balancing algorithms available for HAProxy and think I have identified a better
solution: source ip hashing.  Both of these approaches would accomplish the sticky sessions desired, but ip hashing is
both simple and effective enough for this application.  If the web app involved logins or keeping track of user sessions
or was an e-commerce application, cookies would be the better approach.  It is also easier to set up and sometimes the
simplist solution is the right one.

Going to spend the next few mins working on the loadbalancer role. 

First pass at the load balancer configuration has been completed.  I attempted to run it but encountered the error below:

```
RUNNING HANDLER [lb : Restart HAProxy] ************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
fatal: [lb]: FAILED! => {"changed": false, "msg": "Unable to restart service haproxy: Job for haproxy.service failed because the control process exited with error code.\nSee \"systemctl status haproxy.service\" and \"journalctl -xeu haproxy.service\" for details.\n"}

```

To debug further, I ssh into the haproxy server and ran `sudo systemctl status haproxy` to check on the status.  It was in
a failed state as the error message from ansible indicated it would be.  I checked the system logs using journalctl and
identified the reason why it failed to start.  One of the ports in the desired range 60000-65000 is already in use (see below).

```

I need to figure out what is using this port and kill that process.

I think I identified the issue. The problem is that the `ip_local_port_range` is overlapping with the 60000-65000
range requested for the haproxy.  I could not identify a specific process or application that was using the port but 
I was able to discover that linux by default designates ports in the range of 32768-60999 as ephemeral ports to be used
as needed by a process or service.  This resulted in a conflict where the port binding ranges for the haproxy (60000-65000)
overlapped with this range.  I was able to fix it by adding a task to restrict the ephemeral port range to stop at 59999. 
By doing this, it prevented the conflict I was previously seeing and and allowed the haproxy to successfully bind all
ports in the 60000-65000 range without conflicts.

Once I was able to successfully deploy the haproxy configuration, I was able to confirm the status was in a Ready state
but that the webservers were down (see below log output).  I knew there was nothing wrong with the webservers as I was 
able to verify nginx was running on both servers and both servers were reachable by ping and ssh. during debugging, I 
identified that I was missing a key parameter from the `option httpchk` config in my backend webservers.  I modified 
the haproxy config to explicitly define the correct HTTP method and path for the health check (`option httpchk GET /index.html`).  
Doing this allowed the `200 OK` response codes to come through as the config had a clear request of what I was expecting/
wanting.

```
I just realized that having a defaults folder that just contains the IPs of the webservers is a bad design choice.
Doing this will result in two places that will need to be updated if the IPs were ever to change.  I would like
to keep all updates like this isolated to one place (inventory/hosts file).  I removed the defaults section and
created a loop in jinja templating to loop over all the hosts under `[web]`.  Now if the IPs were to change or
more servers were to be added at a later time, only the hosts file would need to be updated and no other changes
need to be done. I feel this is a much better design choice and I'm glad I caught this now.

Doing some basic testing of functionalty, I was able to verify that all the ports I had requested be bound to the 
backend webservers were being forwarded properly.  I was also able to verify the stickiness was functioning as 
desired as well. All my requests were hitting the same server regardless of port I was using and didn't observe
any server hopping.  I inspected the headers to see if the client IP was being forwarded as requested but was
unable to confirm as I didn't see the `X-Forwarded-For` header in any of the outputs.  Still unsure if it is 
because the config is misconfigured or if there is something else preventing it.  Will need further investigation.

It's about time for dinner so I will be picking this up again tomorrow and do some more research on why the header
is missing. I'm hoping it's just something minor I'm missing. I also want to create a test script that will run
tests for all the conditions and requirements specified in this challenge for the haproxy. I will work on this
tomorrow as well. 

END TIME: 8:53 PM CST


## Next Steps
- Investigate why client IP is not being forwarded
- Write test script to automate loadbalancer tests
- Design/code Nagios monitoring configuration role
- Create better architecture diagram for README (lower priority)
- Refine work notes (add missing pictures and clean up grammar) (lower priority)
