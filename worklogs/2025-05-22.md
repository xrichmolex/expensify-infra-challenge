- Initial pass at loadbalancer configuration
- Test script for loadbalancer testing
- Revised loadbalancer role


## Process

START TIME: 4:14 PM CST

Spent some time trying to figure out what load balancing algorithm to use for this project. Originally I was thinking of
implementing a load based scheduling algorithm with cookies to implement the stickiness that is desired.  However, I
spent some time to review various load balancing algorithms available for HAProxy and think I have identified a better
solution: source ip hashing.  Both of these approaches would accomplish the sticky sessions desired, but ip hashing is
both simple and effective enough for this application.  If the web app involved logins or keeping track of user sessions
or was an e-commerce application, cookies would be the better approach.  It is also easier to set up and sometimes the
simplist solution is the right one.

Going to spend the next few mins working on the loadbalancer role. 



END TIME: 


## Next Steps
- Investigate loadbalancer scheduling algorithms and identify which one to use
- Code loadbalancer configuration role
- Create better architecture diagram for README (lower priority)
