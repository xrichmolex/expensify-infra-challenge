- Addition of host_vars and group_vars
- Updated inventory with aliases
- First pass at webserver role


## Process

START TIME: 4:31 PM CST

Was thinking about this a lot this morning and wrote down a rough outline for the structure of this ansible project over
lunch.  While the structure is tentative and always subject to change, my first inclination is that this is the best
structure for this project.  Going to template it out and create rough files to populate later.

I realized I never verified if ansible had ssh connectivity to the hosts.  Ran an ansible ping test to do a quick connection
test `ansible -i inventory/hosts all -m ping`.  Connectivity verified after I made some modifications to the inventory file.
First I had to provide the ansible_user to all the hosts as I was getting ssh errors due to ansible trying to ssh with my
personal local user when my access key was saved under the `ubuntu` user.  I created a group_vars/all.yml file to pass this
to all the hosts.  Once that was done, connectivity was able to be established.

Time to code the webserver role. 

It's been about 30m or so and I have committed the first pass at the webserver role.  My ansible is a bit rusty as I 
forgot to pass the inventory hosts file during my first couple runs. (classic PEBKAC error).  Had to make a couple 
modifications from my first pass as I wasn't happy with the `index.html` files just having "A" and "B".  I wanted it
to look and feel like a real html page. To do that, ended up creating the html template file to pass to the server and
create some host_vars for the webservers to house the content I wanted each page to have. I chose to do it this way as
it allows for the template to be reused across multiple servers with minimal duplication. For example, if we wanted to 
add another webserver later on that served "C", we can easily do that by adding an entry to the hosts file for the new 
server and a new host_vars file for the new server without having to modify the existing role or playbook(s).

Now that the webservers have been configured, I think the load balancer will be the next item to tackle.  Need to stop
for now and get dinner ready.

END TIME: 7:24 PM CST


## Next Steps
- Investigate loadbalancer scheduling algorithms and identify which one to use
- Code loadbalancer configuration role
- Create better architecture diagram for README (lower priority)
